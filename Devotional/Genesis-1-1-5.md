# Genesis 1:1-5 - The Creation of Light

## Scripture Reading
**Genesis 1:1-5**

### NASB
```
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters. Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light. God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
```

### ESV
```
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
```

### KJV
```
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
```

### Interlinear (Hebrew)
```
בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ
וְהָאָרֶץ הָיְתָה תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ וְחֹשֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵי תְהוֹם וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת עַל־פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם
וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים יְהִי אוֹר וַיְהִי־אוֹר
וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים אֶת־הָאוֹר כִּי־טוֹב וַיַּבְדֵּל אֱלֹהִים בֵּין הָאוֹר וּבֵין הַחֹשֶׁךְ
וַיִּקְרָא אֱלֹהִים לָאוֹר יוֹם וְלַחֹשֶׁךְ קָרָא לָיְלָה וַיְהִי־עֶרֶב וַיְהִי־בֹקֶר יוֹם אֶחָד
```

### Shinkaiyaku (Japanese)
```
初めに、神が天と地を創造した。地は形がなく、何もなかった。やみが大水の上にあり、神の霊が水の上を動いていた。神は「光よ。あれ」と言われた。すると光ができた。神はその光を見て、良いことをお認めになった。神は光とやみとを区別された。神は光を昼と名づけ、やみを夜と名づけられた。夕があり、朝があった。第一日である。
```

## Historical Context
Genesis 1 presents the first creation account in the Bible. It was likely written during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) or post-exile period. The creation narrative would have been particularly meaningful to the Israelites who were surrounded by polytheistic cultures with different creation myths. Genesis 1 emphasizes monotheism and God's sovereignty over all creation.

## Personal Reflections
This passage reveals God's creative power through his spoken word alone. The movement from darkness and chaos to light and order demonstrates God's nature as a God of purpose and design. It's striking how God evaluates his work as "good," establishing a standard of goodness from the very beginning. There's a beautiful rhythm established in creation - evening and morning - that continues to regulate our lives today.

## Application
The creation account reminds me that God brings order out of chaos. When life feels formless and void, God's creative power can bring light and structure. Just as God spoke and creation responded, I should be attentive to God's voice in my life. The separation of light from darkness also serves as a reminder of God's desire for distinction and clarity in my spiritual life. Finally, the rhythm of evening and morning established here is a reminder to find sacred rhythm in my own life.

## Prayer
Heavenly Father, Creator of all things, I stand in awe of your creative power. Thank you for speaking light into existence and for continuing to speak light into the dark areas of my life. Help me to recognize your voice and respond immediately as creation did. May I find peace in the rhythms you've established and rejoice in the goodness of all you've made. Guide me to find purpose in being part of your ongoing creative work in this world. Amen.
