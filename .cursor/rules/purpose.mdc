# Purpose

- I want this vault to be where I take notes for everything in my spiritual life.
- This means I will:
    - take notes during church
    - do a daily devotional
    - make lesson plans
    - and more to come
- I will have sperate folders for each purpose, but they should be connected by tags marking themes, Bible books, date, and more.
- My devotional I would like to start is very in depth.
    - I will be walking through the bible from start to finish.
    - I will be using many bible versions, as well as multiple languages.
    - I want to dive into the history of the bible and build out a context from which to realize it from.
        - This means that I will be using a Greek/Hebrew Bible, and want to incorperate mpas using Leaflet and timelines as much as possible.
        - I want to build out character profiles and geneologies.
        - I want to know the who, what, and why someone wrote the book.
    - I will be writing the bible in all of these versions/languages in Obsidian as I go.
        - NASB
        - ESV
        - KJV
        - Interliner Greek/Hebrew
        - Shinkaiyaku Japanese
    - This is going to take years to do and I will be having very little help from AI for the purpose of the actual study.
    - Due to this complexity, I want well made templates to make it easier to get into the devotional and keep going.
- I want well made templates for these items in particular.
    - The devotional (and the sub points of the devo)
    - Church notes
    - lesson plans
