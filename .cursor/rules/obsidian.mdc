# Obsidian

- This is an obsidian.md vault
- There are plugins already in use, but if you want to use a new plugin feel free to mention it.
- Please use the plugins. I want to have things like timelines and maps.
- Make good use of the frontmatter and tags.
- Use the Templeter plugin for making templates in the `/Templates` folder.
- attacments go in the `/images` folder.
- CSS will go in `/.obsidian/snippets`.
- JS or other scripts will go in `/scripts`.
- The main [README.md](mdc:README.md) already exists and will be the default file. This should be updated with any new information or setup instructions.
- I want to use the heatmap on [README.md](mdc:README.md) to keep track of when I make or update new files.
- Do not attempt to create folders yourself, but instead inform me if it needs done.
- Any plugins we have are listed in `/.obsidian/plugins`.
