## Family Connections
Abraham was the son of Terah, husband to Sarah (originally named Sarai), and took Hagar as a concubine. He fathered Ishmael through Hagar and Isaac through Sarah.

## Scripture References
- Genesis 11:27-25:11 - The primary narrative of Abraham's life
- Isaiah 41:8 - Called "friend of God"
- Romans 4 - Abraham as an example of justification by faith
- Hebrews 11:8-19 - Abraham in the "hall of faith"
- James 2:21-23 - Abraham's faith demonstrated by works

## Character Traits
- Faith and obedience - Willing to leave his homeland and later sacrifice his son
- Hospitality - Welcomed strangers (who were divine messengers)
- Intercessory - Pleaded with God for Sodom and Gomorrah
- Occasionally fearful - Twice claimed Sarah was his sister out of fear
- Persistent in prayer - Continued to believe God's promise despite his age

## Faith Journey
Abraham's spiritual journey begins with his call out of Ur, a pagan city, to follow the one true God. His faith develops through numerous tests and challenges. While he occasionally takes matters into his own hands (with Hagar, or claiming Sarah is his sister), his overall trajectory is one of increasing trust in God. The ultimate test of his faith—his willingness to sacrifice Isaac—demonstrates his complete trust that God would fulfill His promises, even if it meant raising Isaac from the dead (Hebrews 11:19).

## Significant Relationships
- Sarah - His wife and partner in faith, though their relationship was tested by infertility
- Lot - His nephew whom he rescued, showing Abraham's loyalty to family
- Hagar - Complex relationship with the Egyptian maidservant who bore Ishmael
- Ishmael - His firstborn son whom he loved but had to send away
- Isaac - The son of promise, whom he was willing to sacrifice in obedience to God

## Legacy
Abraham is revered as the patriarch of three major world religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. For Jews and Christians, he represents the beginning of God's covenant relationship with His people. His willingness to believe God despite impossible circumstances (Romans 4:18-21) makes him the "father of all who believe." His intercession for Sodom demonstrates his compassionate nature, and his willingness to sacrifice Isaac shows ultimate surrender to God.

## Lessons From Their Life
Abraham's life teaches us about walking by faith, not by sight. God's promises often take time to fulfill, and the journey requires patience and perseverance. Abraham's mistakes remind us that even great people of faith are human and fallible, yet God remains faithful to His promises. His willingness to sacrifice Isaac teaches about complete surrender to God's will, trusting that God's purposes are good even when we don't understand.

## Notes
Abraham's life spans approximately 175 years according to Genesis 25:7. While exact dating is difficult, most scholars place him in the early second millennium BCE. His journey of faith has become archetypal for believers across millennia, and his willingness to leave comfort for God's call continues to inspire faith journeys today.
