Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.

Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
- Matthew 5:3-12 (ESV)

## Materials Needed
- Bibles (multiple translations if possible)
- Handout with Beatitudes listed
- Whiteboard and markers
- Projector for slides/maps
- Index cards for reflection activity

## Introduction (Time: 10 minutes)
Begin by asking participants what they think makes for a happy or blessed life. Write their responses on the whiteboard. Then introduce the Beatitudes as Jesus' unexpected and counter-cultural teaching on true blessedness. Briefly explain that the Sermon on the Mount was one of Jesus' most significant teaching moments and the Beatitudes form its introduction.

## Main Content
### Part 1: Historical Context (Time: 10 minutes)
The Sermon on the Mount takes place early in Jesus' ministry in Galilee. Jesus has been traveling, teaching, and healing, gathering large crowds. He goes up on a mountainside - a traditional place for important teaching in Jewish culture, reminiscent of Moses receiving the Law on Mount Sinai. The audience would have been primarily Jewish, living under Roman occupation, with various expectations about the coming Messiah and kingdom of God.

### Part 2: Understanding "Blessed" (Time: 15 minutes)
The Greek word "makarios" translated as "blessed" refers to a state of happiness or well-being that comes from God, not dependent on circumstances. This is different from typical worldly happiness. Each Beatitude follows a pattern: pronouncement of blessing + description of those blessed + promise of reward. Discuss how Jesus is not merely describing temporary emotions but a state of being in right relationship with God.

### Part 3: Examining Each Beatitude (Time: 20 minutes)
Walk through each Beatitude, explaining:
- "Poor in spirit" - recognizing spiritual poverty and need for God
- "Those who mourn" - grieving over sin and brokenness
- "The meek" - humble, gentle, submitted to God
- "Hunger and thirst for righteousness" - passionate desire for God's ways
- "Merciful" - showing compassion to others
- "Pure in heart" - internal integrity and devotion to God
- "Peacemakers" - actively working for reconciliation
- "Persecuted for righteousness" - remaining faithful despite opposition

## Group Activities/Discussion Questions
1. Which Beatitude challenges conventional wisdom most significantly? Why?
2. Which Beatitude do you find most difficult to understand or live out?
3. How do these teachings contrast with what our culture typically values or celebrates?

## Historical/Cultural Context
The religious environment of first-century Palestine included various Jewish groups with different interpretations of what made one blessed or righteous. Pharisees emphasized strict adherence to the Law and external purity. The Essenes sought separation from corrupt society. The Zealots believed political liberation was the path to blessing. Against these backgrounds, Jesus offers a radically different view of what it means to be blessed by God.

## Application
Distribute index cards and ask participants to select one Beatitude that they want to focus on in the coming week. Have them write the Beatitude on one side and a specific way they will try to live it out on the other side. Encourage them to place the card somewhere they'll see it daily as a reminder.

## Conclusion (Time: 5 minutes)
The Beatitudes are not just nice sayings but a radical reframing of what it means to be blessed and to participate in God's kingdom. Jesus is not only describing traits to aspire to but is also offering comfort to those already experiencing difficulty. These teachings set the stage for the entire Sermon on the Mount and show us the character of Christ himself, which he invites us to share in.

## Follow-up/Homework
Read the rest of Matthew 5 before next week. Journal about which Beatitude resonates most with your current life situation and why.
